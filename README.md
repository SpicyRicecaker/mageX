# mageX

Now live at (prompurr.org)[prompurr.org]!

## why?

Sentence mining video games for audio and video is extremely easy. First use textractor to hook text and copy, then search said text in dictionary to get definition. Get visuals from a screenshot, and audio from a screen recorder.

However, issues arise when some game cannot be hooked onto using textractor. Therefore, mageX aims to *get the text from the game as efficiently as possible using image recognition*.
